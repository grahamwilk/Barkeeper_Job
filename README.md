# MC_Brewery_Sell_Menu
plugin to create a sell menu to sell brews created from the brewery plugin. Requires the Jobs &amp; Brewery plugin to also be installed.

What I learned while making this:

* I learned to code in Java, using skills gained from coding in C#.
* I improved my skills with logic and coding in general through creating a system to calculate payment based on what is being sold.
* I improved my learning skills by learning how to code with new assets and coding plugins that I have never used before.
* I learned how to create a product that can be used and downloaded by other people, that is of good quality.
