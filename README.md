# MC_Brewery_Sell_Menu
Creates a new command (/barkeepersellmenu) where you can sell brews crafted for a new Barkeeper job.

Requires both Breweryx & Jobs to be installed, and the Barkeeper.yml file to be added to the /jobs directory for the Jobs plugin. This contains configuration for the default breweryx recipes, but more can be added in a similar format.
